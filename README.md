Background & Purpose

For CIS 526 we were tasked with finding a problem and creating a solution. We have noticed a lack of a centralized place for people that play video games to come together to talk about the games they love with people of similar interests.  Each console, PC digital distribution platform, and even individual game have their own dedicated forums. We think we can improve on this experience by by creating a video game social network to bring these gamers together. We are providing features such as community building (ie. having a friends list), cross-platform discussions (ie. forums), new genre exploration, and new game recommendations  (ie. genre and game recommendations based on what you have already played and liked). We are using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js) following a Model View Controller architectural pattern. We are using MongoDB for our database to store user information and forum data and TheGamesDB for information on almost 50,000 video games. 

Results

For now, we aren’t completed our project, therefore we don’t have enough information for this section. We will have an updated abstract at Open House.

Recommendations for Future Work

Some features that we would like to include down the road would include things such as live voice chat across all platforms. This would allow for friends to still interact with one another, even if they weren’t playing the same games or even on the same platform. We would also like to implement the ability to compete across platforms. This would look like global leaderboards for games that are on multiple devices. A marketplace to buy, sell, and trade in game assets for across games would also be a neat feature. Also, since this is a social network designed for gamers, it might be smart to integrate our social network with mainstream social networks to introduce more people to the communities that will
